        <h2>ðŸŒ¿ Well Leaf Me Be! You're on Your Way! ðŸŒ¿</h2>

        <p>Congratulations, sprouting Plant Parent! Your score shows you've got some soil under your nails, and you're
            not afraid to use it. You're in that sweet spot where your plants probably don't fear for their lives every
            day... just every other day.</p>

        <h3>On the bright side:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Your plants are surviving.</strong> And in the world of plant parenting, "surviving" is just a
                step away from "thriving."</li>
            <li><strong>You're learning.</strong> Every brown leaf and droopy stem is a lesson in disguise. Who knew
                plants needed water AND sunlight, right?</li>
            <li><strong>You've got potential.</strong> Like a late-blooming perennial, your full plant-parent prowess is
                just waiting for the right season to shine.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Boost your botanical brilliance:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Embrace the plant community:</strong> There are forums, social media groups, and local clubs
                overflowing with people who love to share their green-thumbed wisdom.</li>
            <li><strong>Diversify your garden:</strong> Try caring for a new type of plant. Sometimes, the right match
                can turn a black thumb green.</li>
            <li><strong>Patience, patience, patience:</strong> Plants grow at their own pace, and so will your skills.
                Keep at it, and you'll see the fruits (or flowers) of your labor in no time.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>So, don't leaf things to chance! Your path to becoming a Plant Master is well underway. Just remember, the
            grass is always greener... when you remember to water it.</p>
