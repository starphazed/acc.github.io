        <div class="history">
            The pinhole camera, with its deep <a href="page_01.html">historical roots</a>, represents a fundamental step
            in the development of
            photographic technology and the study of optics. Originating in ancient times, its principle was first
            documented by scholars such as Mozi and Aristotle, who observed how light travels through small openings to
            project images.
        </div>
        <div class="art">
            Its historical significance extends beyond <a href="page_02.html">art</a>, as it was also employed in
            scientific observations, notably
            in the study of solar eclipses and the <a href="page_03.html">sun's</a> movements. The evolution of the
            pinhole camera from a simple
            observational tool to a sophisticated device for capturing images underscores its enduring impact on both
            technology and our understanding of the natural world.

        <div class="ray">A pinhole camera captures images using the simple optical principle of light traveling in
            straight lines. When a <a href="page_04.html">single ray of light</a> from an external scene passes through
            the small aperture (the pinhole) of the camera, it projects an inverted image of the scene onto the surface opposite the hole,
            typically photographic paper or a digital sensor inside the camera.</div>
            <div class="fresnel"> In educational settings, constructing pinhole cameras serves as a practical, hands-on
                method to teach the fundamentals of light and vision, demonstrating the enduring relevance of this ancient
                principle. Furthermore, this phenomenon is utilized in <a href="page_05.html">scientific and medical instruments</a> showcasing its
                versatility and continued importance in both understanding and harnessing the nature of light in
                contemporary society.</div>
