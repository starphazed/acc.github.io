            Rainbows, those ephemeral spectacles of natural beauty, emerge from the interplay between <a href="page_01.html">sunlight</a> and
            moisture in the atmosphere, embodying a phenomenon where science and wonder intertwine. As beams of sunlight
            encounter water droplets suspended in the air, a series of optical processes unfold. Initially, the light
            <a href="page_05.html">refracts</a> as it enters each droplet, bending and splitting into its constituent colors. This <a href="page_04.html">dispersion of
                light</a> continues inside the droplet, with each color bending at slightly different angles due to their
            varying wavelengths, creating a spectrum. </div>
        <div class="div3">This <a href="page_02.html">spectrum of colors</a> is then reflected off the inner surface of the water droplet and
            refracts once more as it exits, reaching the observer's eye as a radiant arc across the sky. From red at its
            outer edge to violet at its innermost, a rainbow displays the full breadth of visible light, offering a
            splendid visual explanation of the dispersion and refraction of sunlight. Beyond their breathtaking beauty,
            rainbows serve as a portal to the <a href="index.html">study of the sun</a> and atmospheric sciences, allowing scientists to explore
            the properties of light and the complex ways in which it interacts with the elements of our world. </div>
