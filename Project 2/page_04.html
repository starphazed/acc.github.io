        <div class="div1">A prism, typically made of glass or another transparent material, serves as a fundamental
            optical instrument that beautifully demonstrates the phenomena of refraction and dispersion. When a single
            ray of light enters a prism, it is refracted, or bent, at the interface between air and the glass material.
            This bending occurs because light travels at different speeds in different media â€“ slower in denser
            materials like glass than in air. The degree of bending depends on the light's wavelength, which is why a
            prism can split a <a href="index.html">single ray of white light</a> into its constituent colors, a process known as dispersion. Each
            color, from violet to red, bends at a slightly different angle due to its unique wavelength, spreading out
            to form a spectrum. </div>
        <div class="div2"> The distinction between refraction and <a href="page_02.html">reflection</a> is pivotal in understanding how prisms
            work. While refraction involves the bending of light as it passes through a medium, leading to dispersion,
            reflection is the process by which light bounces off a surface. Prisms utilize refraction to reveal the
            spectrum hidden within white light, unlike mirrors, which reflect light without dispersing it. The precise
            angles and the quality of the glass material are crucial in determining the effectiveness of a prism in
            <a href="page_03.html">dispersing light</a> High-quality optical glass with minimal imperfections is preferred to ensure that light is
            accurately refracted and that the spectrum is clear and vibrant.</div>
        <div class="div3"> In science, prisms have played a <a href="page_01.html">crucial role in studying light</a> and its properties. By
            dispersing light into its component colors, prisms have enabled scientists to analyze the composition of
            light sources, leading to significant discoveries in physics and astronomy. For example, by examining the
            spectral lines in the light from stars and galaxies, astronomers can determine their chemical composition,
            temperature, and movement. This analysis, known as spectroscopy, has become an indispensable tool in modern
            astrophysics. Additionally, prisms have applications in various <a href="page_05.html">optical devices</a> including cameras,
            binoculars, and lasers, showcasing their versatility and the enduring importance of understanding
            light's fundamental behaviors. Through the simple yet profound mechanics of a prism, the complex nature of
            light is unveiled, bridging the gap between observable phenomena and the intricate laws of physics that
            govern our universe.</div>
